# CNN-Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Classifcation

Hello and welcome to our Brain Tumor detection system.

1) Brain Tumor Classification (Variant 1).ipynb
	In this code we "Train and Test" our model using the dataset aquired.

2) Brain Tumor Classification (Variant 2).ipynb
	The enhanced version of the code above. (NOTE: Requires higher computational power, greater device specs to run smoothly)

3) GUI Prediction Model.ipynb
	Almost similar to the "Test model". This predction model is used by the GUI to predict the incoming inputs via the GUI.

4) Brain Tumor GUI.ipynb
	The GUI code where the users can interact with the system to get the predictions.

"Demo.mkv"  
This shows the demostration of how the system works if a user intents to use it.


NOTE: If anyone faces difficulties while using the provided code. Please feel free to contact us anytime; so that we can be of assisstance.
